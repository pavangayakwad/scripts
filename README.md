# scripts
xrdp-installer-1.1.sh 
----------------------------
The script is borrowed from http://www.c-nergy.be - http://www.c-nergy.be/blog and his comments are retained as is in the script. It is tuned to work well with Peppermint OS 10. 

docker
-----------------------------
Tried to have linux container helps to run VS code and eclipse on GDI+ becuase Windows fails badly at rending fonts in these IDEs.

code1401.deb	- should be replaced with proper deb file of VS code installer
eclipse19-09R_x64.tar.gz - should be replaced with proper eclipse tar ball downloaded from eclipse site.
